# OpenCV Ball Tracker


I have implemented a simple ball tracker using Open CV as a way to understand the basics of computer vision. The tracker will trap the ball in these example videos and track the center of the ball throughout it's movement. 

A **Kalman Filter** was also implmented as a way to predict the trajectory of the red ball. The x coordinates of the ball, as well as the position created by the Kalman Filter, is exported to CSV files as a way to graphically demonstrate the differences.
